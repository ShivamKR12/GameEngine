## üìñ **About the Project**  
**GameEngine** is a Python game engine that combines the strengths of three powerful libraries:  
- **[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/):** For advanced 3D rendering and scene management.  
- **[Raylib-Py](https://github.com/overdev/raylib-py):** For efficient low-level graphics and physics handling.  
- **[Pygame-CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce):** For easy input handling and 2D game components.  

This engine is designed to be modular, high-performance, and flexible, focusing on backend logic rather than GUI editors.
